            <h2>Quick Tips:</h2>
            <p>
            Having patience and not having the expectation to learn how to solve it in the day is very important...don't be me in the beginning. It's not actually as hard as it seems though at all.<br><br>
            Its all algorithms like math and to solve the math problem you just have to REMEMBER the algorithem. The rubiks cube is just building muscle memory. For example, how you build muscle memory on where the position the keys are on the keyboard so then you don't have to look at the keyboard anymore.<br><br> You'll see why after learning how to solve it why the first layer is so hard to explain to a beginner.

            <h2>Step 1:</h2>
                <p>Step 1 is remembering the turn movements. Turn movements positions are used in solving the cube, but mainly for the algorithms in solving. <br><br>Algorithems are especially used in the 3rd and 4th steps of solving for OLL(For the yellow layer) and for PLL(For the last layer)<br> Some quick tips I can give is that for example if you look at the image to the right you'll see that opposite movements are inverted. Another tip is that the 'i' in movements means inverted; most algorithms even in the link images below for the OLL and PLL with not have Ri but will have R'. The apostrophe means exactly the same thing as i(inverted) The last tip i'll give is if you see a movement say R2 that just simply means R twice. <br><br>The image to the right is for learning and remembering the movements:</p>
