                <p>I buy cubes from <a href="https://www.thecubicle.com/"><em>The Cubicle</em></a>
                I have made around 8 orders from them over the past two and a half years and the items always arrive on time.<br>
                Also, using the App on my phone called <a href="https://shop.app/"><em>Shop</em></a>, I can track where my package is located.
                I mainly use the Cubicle though for ordering more than 1 item,<br> which makes it a good site for buying
                items from when starting out. If you're just buying a singular cube, it's cheaper to buy from <em>Amazon</em>.</p></div>

                Its my favorite starter cube and actually my main cube I still use today despite having other cubes.
                I personally magnetized mine and lubricate it once a month and its by far my personal favorite.
