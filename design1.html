                <h2>My personal story:</h2>
                <p>It was during my 2nd year living in Korea going to school (Around 8th grade),
                I met someone who could solve the rubiks cube in 15 seconds (now 10 or below).
                He showed me some basics and also some sites to learn from which i'll link below.
                <strong>Its not a process that you can expect to do within a day</strong>(it is possible), but its
                very much possible to learn how to solve a rubiks cube in a week even or on the weekend.
                It took me only around 2 weeks to learn how to solve one. </p>
