	<h2>My personal story:</h2>
	<p>It was during my 2nd year living in Korea going to school (Around 8th grade), 
	I met someone who could solve the rubiks cube in 15 seconds (now 10 or below).<br> 
	He showed me some basics and also some sites to learn from which i'll link below. 
	<strong>Its not a process that you can expect to do within a day</strong>(it is possible),<br> but its 
	very much possible to learn how to solve a rubiks cube in a week even or on the weekend.
	It took me only around 2 weeks to learn how to solve one.

	<h2>Tips on Solving the Rubiks Cube:</h2>
	<ol>
	<li>Having patience is very important, its not actually as hard as it seems</li>
	<li>Its all algorithms like math, think of it like you're trying to solve
	a math problem and if you use the right algorithem you'll get the right answer.
	<br>It's the exact same thing with solving the rubiks cube.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Cubes to Buy and sites:</h2>
	<p>I buy cubes from <a href="https://www.thecubicle.com/"><em>The Cubicle</em></a>
	I have made around 8 orders from them over the past two and a half years and the items always arrive on time.<br>
	Also, using the App on my phone called <a href="https://shop.app/"><em>Shop</em></a>, I can track where my package is located.
	I mainly use the Cubicle though for ordering more than 1 item,<br> which makes it a good site for buying
	items from when starting out. If you just want to buy a singular cube i personally would
	recommend amazon and a cube from below:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.thecubicle.com/products/yuxin-little-magic-3x3?_pos=9&_psq=yuxin%20litt%2A%20OR%20body%3A%22yuxin%20litt%22&_ss=e&_v=1.0&variant=19674699006025">The Yuxin Little Magic 3x3.</a>
	Its my favorite starter cube and actually my main cube I still use today despite having other cubes.
	<br>I personally magnetized mine and lubricate it once a month and its by far my personal favorite.<br>My Yuxin:<br>

	<div id="CL">
	<h2> Cube Maintenance:</h2>
	<p>Depending on usage and determination to get faster,
	its important and best to in my opinion,<br>to clean your cubes
	inner parts once a month with a towel and water and lubricate
	your cube once week. <br>
